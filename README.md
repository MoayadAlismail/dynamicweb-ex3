# dynamicweb-ex3
I really enjoyed working on this project, and my favorite part was fetching data from my API. I focused on making the design as beautiful and modern as possible, incorporating a clean, contemporary aesthetic. I added subtle hover effects to the navbar and header for a more dynamic feel. The icons were made slightly transparent to enhance the overall look, and I used the Montserrat font, which I imported from Google Fonts. Fun fact: this is the same font used by NYU!

One feature I had planned was to make the background color change based on the time of dayâ€”dark blue at night and a brighter color in the morning. Unfortunately, I couldn't fetch the actual time from the OpenWeather API, as it only provided the time zone, not the specific hour. Instead, I used the cloudiness as a proxy to determine the background color.

I also realized that OpenWeather already provides weather icons, so there was no need to import them from Font Awesome. However, importing icons from libraries can still be useful if you want more customization. For security, I stored my API key in a .env file to keep it safe.
